              I started the process of growing up in Miami, Florida, a uniquely frothing pot of ideas and culture and and energy. I went on to go to school in Pennsylvania, where I studied math, physics, and philosophy, and came to realize how much more there was to learn. As a student, I was always most drawn to problem solving on the boundaries of disciplines. I wasn't done studying, but my four years were up, so I transfered myself, in my ongoing process of growing up, over to Vermont, to work and live for awhile. I traveled by bicycle across the country with a good friend, and when we returned, so energized by having made it all the way across just by pedaling, I began selling chocolate at the farmers' market. Creating a milkless milk chocolate had been a fantasy for me, and finally I'd found the fortitude and the opportunity to start a small business. Schmilk Chocolate has been a wonderful and difficult adventure. We're carried regionally by Whole Foods, and our cashew-milk chocolate has been requested by national chains as well. The biggest difficulty in business has been raising money, which I've come to understand is the case for most small business owners trying to scale. Today, I run the business with a trusted partner, and I'm ready to branch out into new endeavors. Lately, I've discovered a new passion in creating software. Computer science has so much depth and mystery to it, and so far I'm just getting started in this new field. Programming is a great thing to work on, because I can identify defined problems I'm passionate about solving, and then in the process of solving any given problem, learning beyond the scope of the problem is happily inevitable!
